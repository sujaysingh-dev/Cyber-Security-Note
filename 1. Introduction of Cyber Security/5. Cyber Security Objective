The objectives of cybersecurity focus on protecting digital systems, data, and networks from cyber threats. These objectives are often guided by the CIA Triad:

🔑 1. Confidentiality
  Ensure that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized users.
  Protect data from unauthorized access or disclosure.

🔧 2. Integrity
  Maintain the accuracy and trustworthiness of data.
  Prevent unauthorized changes or tampering with information.

🌐 3. Availability
  Ensure systems, data, and services are accessible when needed.
  Protect against disruptions like DDoS attacks or hardware failures.

🛡️ Other Key Objectives:
  Authentication – Verify the identity of users and systems.
  Non-repudiation – Ensure actions or transactions cannot be denied later.
  Risk Management – Identify, assess, and reduce security risks.
  Incident Response – Detect, respond to, and recover from cyber incidents.
