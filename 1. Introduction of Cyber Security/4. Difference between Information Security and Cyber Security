Information Security and Cybersecurity are closely related but not the same. Both aim to protect data, but they focus on different areas.

1. Information Security:
  Definition: Protects all types of information, whether it's digital, physical, or spoken.
  Scope: Includes paper documents, physical files, verbal communication, and digital data.
  Goal: Ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information.
  Example: Locking a file cabinet or encrypting sensitive files.

2. Cybersecurity:
  Definition: Protects digital systems, networks, and data from cyber threats like hacking, malware, or ransomware.
  Scope: Focused only on digital environments (computers, servers, networks, cloud, etc.).
  Goal: Defend against unauthorized digital access, cyberattacks, and data breaches.
  Example: Installing firewalls, antivirus software, or securing a Wi-Fi network.

Key Differences:
  Aspect	      Information Security	                            Cybersecurity
  Focus	        All forms of information	                        Digital data and systems
  Coverage	    Broader (includes physical data)	                Narrower (focused on cyber threats)
  Threats       Addressed	Theft, loss, unauthorized access	      Hacking, malware, phishing, etc.
  Example       Measures	Paper shredders, access controls	      Firewalls, antivirus, encryption
