Cybersecurity means protecting computers, networks, and data from attacks, like hacking, viruses, and online scams.
Situational Awareness in cybersecurity means knowing what’s happening in your digital systems — spotting problems early and reacting quickly.

🔐 Why Situational Awareness Matters in Cybersecurity:
  Helps you see threats early (like strange logins or unusual behavior).
  Lets you act fast before damage happens.
  Keeps your data and systems safe and secure.
  Helps in making smart decisions during an attack.

🛠 How to Improve It:
  Monitor systems regularly (using tools that watch for danger).
  Train staff to notice warning signs (like phishing emails).
  Use alerts that warn you about unusual activity.
  Share information about threats with others.
