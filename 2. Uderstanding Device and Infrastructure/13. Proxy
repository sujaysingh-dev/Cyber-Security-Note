What is a Proxy Server?
    A proxy server is a system or application that acts as an intermediary between a userâ€™s device (like a computer or smartphone) and the internet. It receives requests from the user, processes them, and then forwards them to the destination server. When the destination server responds, the proxy sends the data back to the user. This setup helps in managing and securing network traffic.

Key Functions of a Proxy Server:
    Anonymity and Privacy: By masking the user's IP address, a proxy server helps in maintaining privacy and anonymity online.
    Access Control: Organizations use proxies to restrict access to certain websites or content, ensuring compliance with internal policies.
    Caching: Frequently accessed data can be stored temporarily, reducing load times and conserving bandwidth.=
    Security: Proxies can filter out malicious content and provide an additional layer of defense against cyber threats.
    Bypass Geo-restrictions: Users can access content that is restricted in their region by routing their requests through servers in permitted locations.

Types of Proxy Servers:
    Forward Proxy: Positioned between the client and the internet, it forwards client requests to the internet.
    Reverse Proxy: Sits between the internet and a web server, forwarding requests from the internet to the web server.
    Transparent Proxy: Intercepts requests without modifying them, often used for content filtering.
    Anonymous Proxy: Hides the user's IP address, providing anonymity.
    High Anonymity Proxy: Does not reveal the user's IP address and does not identify itself as a proxy server.

Proxy vs. VPN:
    While both proxies and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) route your internet traffic through an intermediary server, the key differences lie in encryption and security:
      Proxy:     Routes traffic through an intermediary server, but typically does not encrypt the data, making it faster but less secure.
      VPN:       Encrypts all traffic between the user and the VPN server, offering enhanced security and privacy, but may result in slightly slower speeds due to encryption overhead.

Common Use Cases:
    Organizations: To monitor and control employee internet usage and to secure internal networks.
    Individuals: To maintain privacy, access region-restricted content, or bypass censorship.
    Web Scraping: To collect data from websites without revealing the user's identity.
