üîê What is Network Access Control (NAC)?
    Network Access Control (NAC) is a security approach that manages and enforces policies governing which devices and users can access a network. It ensures that only compliant, authenticated, and trusted devices are allowed to connect, thereby protecting the network from unauthorized access and potential threats. 
    
üõ°Ô∏è Key Functions of NAC
    Authentication & Authorization: Verifies the identity of users and devices before granting access.
    Compliance Enforcement: Ensures devices meet security policies, such as having up-to-date antivirus software or security patches.
    Access Control: Defines and enforces who can access specific network resources based on roles and policies.
    Monitoring & Reporting: Tracks and logs network access activities for auditing and compliance purposes.
    Remediation: Takes corrective actions, like quarantining non-compliant devices, until they meet security standards. 

‚öôÔ∏è How NAC Works
    Pre-Admission Checks: Before granting network access, NAC evaluates the security posture of devices to ensure they comply with organizational policies.
    Post-Admission Monitoring: After access is granted, NAC continuously monitors device activities to detect and respond to any suspicious behavior.
    Policy Enforcement: NAC enforces security policies by allowing or restricting access based on device compliance and user roles.
    Incident Response: In case of policy violations or security threats, NAC can isolate affected devices, alert administrators, and initiate remediation processes. 

üß© Types of NAC Implementations
    Agent-Based NAC: Requires installing software agents on devices to monitor and enforce policies.
    Agentless NAC: Does not require agents; instead, it uses network infrastructure and protocols to assess device compliance.
    Out-of-Band NAC: Operates separately from the network traffic path, providing centralized policy enforcement.
    In-Band NAC: Integrates directly into the network traffic path, allowing real-time policy enforcement. 

‚úÖ Benefits of NAC
    Enhanced Security: Protects the network by ensuring only compliant devices can connect.
    Regulatory Compliance: Helps organizations meet industry standards and regulations by enforcing security policies.
    Reduced Risk: Minimizes the potential for data breaches and cyberattacks by controlling access.
    Operational Efficiency: Automates access control and monitoring, reducing the administrative burden.
