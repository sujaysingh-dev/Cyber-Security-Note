What is a Firewall?
      A firewall is a security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts like a barrier or filter between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks (like the internet).

Purpose of a Firewall:
      Block unauthorized access to your network or devices.
      Allow safe and approved traffic to pass through.
      Protect against cyber threats like hackers, malware, and viruses.

Types of Firewalls:
    Type	                                  Description
    Packet-Filtering Firewall	              Inspects packets and allows or blocks them based on IP address, port, and protocol. Basic and fast.
    Stateful Inspection Firewall	          Tracks the state of active connections and makes decisions based on context. More secure than packet-filtering.
    Proxy Firewall (Application Firewall)	  Acts as an intermediary between users and the internet, filtering traffic at the application layer. Can block specific content or apps.
    Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)	        Combines traditional firewall features with additional capabilities like intrusion prevention, deep packet inspection, and application awareness.
    Hardware Firewall	                      Physical device installed between your network and the internet (e.g., router with firewall).
    Software Firewall	                      Installed on individual computers or devices to protect them specifically.

How Firewalls Work:
    Inspect Traffic: Check data packets entering or leaving the network.
    Compare Rules: Match packets against security rules set by the admin.
    Allow or Block: Based on rules, decide whether to let the traffic pass or block it.

âœ… Why Firewalls Matter:
    Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    Protect against attacks and malware.
    Help enforce company security policies.
    Act as the first line of defense in network security.
