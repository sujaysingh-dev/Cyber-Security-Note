What is a Load Balancer?
    A load balancer is a device or software that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. This improves the performance, reliability, and scalability of applications and websites.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
    Traffic Distribution: The load balancer receives incoming requests and forwards them to the least busy or most available server.
    Health Monitoring: It continuously checks the health of servers. If one fails, traffic is redirected to healthy servers.
    Session Persistence: For applications requiring it, the load balancer can ensure that a user's session is consistently directed to the same server.

üß© Types of Load Balancers
    Layer 4 (Transport Layer): Operates at the TCP/UDP level. It makes routing decisions based on IP address and port. It's faster but less flexible.
    Layer 7 (Application Layer): Operates at the HTTP/HTTPS level. It can make routing decisions based on content, such as URL paths or HTTP headers. It's more flexible but slightly slower.

‚úÖ Benefits
    Improved Performance: By distributing traffic, it prevents any single server from becoming a bottleneck.
    High Availability: If one server goes down, traffic is rerouted to healthy servers.
    Scalability: As demand grows, more servers can be added to the pool without disrupting service.
    Security: Can provide features like SSL termination and protection against certain types of attacks
