üìß What is a Mail Gateway?
      A Mail Gateway is a security solution that acts as a barrier between an organization's internal email system and external email traffic. It filters and monitors all incoming and outgoing emails to protect against threats such as malware, phishing, spam, and data breaches. By inspecting email content, attachments, and metadata, a mail gateway ensures that only legitimate emails reach the user's inbox, while malicious ones are blocked or quarantined.

      Spam Prevention: Identifies and blocks unsolicited and potentially harmful emails.
      Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Monitors outgoing emails to prevent sensitive information from being sent outside the organization.
      Email Encryption: Secures email content during transmission to protect against interception.
