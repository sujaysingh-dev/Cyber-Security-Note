Designing with security in mind means building systems, software, and networks in a way that prevents cyber threats from the start, rather than fixing problems later. It’s also called “security by design.”

🔑 Key Principles:
    Secure by Default
        Systems should have strong security settings enabled automatically (e.g., password policies, firewalls).
    Least Privilege
        Give users only the access they need to do their job — nothing more.
    Defense in Depth
        Use multiple layers of security (e.g., firewall, antivirus, intrusion detection) to reduce risk.
    Threat Modeling
        Identify possible threats early during the design phase and plan how to stop them.
    Input Validation
        Make sure user input is clean to prevent attacks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting.
    Secure Communication
        Use encryption (e.g., HTTPS, VPN) to protect data in transit.
    Regular Updates & Patching
        Design systems that can be easily updated to fix new vulnerabilities.
    Audit & Logging
        Keep records of activity to detect and investigate security issues.

🧠 Why It Matters:
    Prevents data breaches
    Reduces long-term costs
    Protects users and systems
    Builds trust with customers
