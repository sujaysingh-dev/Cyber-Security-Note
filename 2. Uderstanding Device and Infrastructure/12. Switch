What is a Switch?
    A switch is a networking device that connects multiple devices (like computers, printers, servers) within the same local network (LAN) and forwards data only to the intended recipient device.

Key Functions of a Switch:
    Connects devices in a network: Allows devices to communicate with each other.
    Data forwarding: Sends data directly to the device itâ€™s meant for, not to all devices.
    MAC address learning: Keeps a table of device MAC addresses to efficiently route data.
    Improves network speed: Reduces unnecessary data traffic by sending packets only to the destination device.

How is a Switch Different from a Hub?
    Feature	                          Switch	                                                        Hub
    Data forwarding	                  Sends data to the specific device (MAC address)	                Sends data to all devices (broadcast)
    Network efficiency	              High (less collisions)	                                        Low (more collisions)
    Security	                        Better, since data is not broadcast	                            Lower, data goes to all devices
