What is a Router?
    A router is a networking device that connects multiple networks together and directs data packets between them. It decides the best path for data to travel from the source to the destination.

Key Functions of a Router:
    Connects different networks: For example, connects your home network to the internet.
    Routes data packets: Determines the best route for data to reach its destination efficiently.
    Assigns IP addresses: Often acts as a DHCP server, giving devices their local IP addresses.
    Network traffic management: Controls and manages data flow to avoid congestion.
    Provides security: Often includes built-in firewalls and other security features.

Where is a Router Used?
    Home networks to connect computers, phones, and smart devices to the internet.
    Business networks to manage internal communication and internet access.
    Large networks (like ISPs) to route data between multiple locations.
