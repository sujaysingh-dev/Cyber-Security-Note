ðŸ“Œ What is a Port?
      A port is like a door or gateway on a computer or server that allows specific types of network traffic to enter or leave. Each port has a number (from 0 to 65535) that identifies a particular service or application.
      Example: Port 80 is commonly used for web traffic (HTTP).
      Ports help organize and manage different types of data traffic on a device.

ðŸ“¡ What is a Protocol?
      A protocol is a set of rules that devices follow to communicate with each other over a network. Protocols define how data is formatted, transmitted, and received.
