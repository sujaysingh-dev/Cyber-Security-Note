üì° What is a Wireless Access Point (WAP)?
    A Wireless Access Point (WAP) is a device that allows wireless devices‚Äîsuch as smartphones, laptops, and tablets‚Äîto connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi. It acts as a bridge between the wired network (like Ethernet) and wireless devices, enabling them to communicate with each other 

üîß Key Functions of a Wireless Access Point
    Connectivity: Provides Wi-Fi access to devices, allowing them to connect to the network without physical cables.
    Signal Distribution: Distributes the network's signal over a specified area, enabling wireless coverage in homes, offices, or public spaces.
    Network Expansion: Extends the reach of a network by connecting additional access points, creating a larger wireless network.
    Security: Implements security protocols like WPA3 to protect the network from unauthorized access.

üñ•Ô∏è How It Works
    Connection to Wired Network: The WAP connects to a router or switch via an Ethernet cable, integrating the wireless network with the wired infrastructure.
    Signal Transmission: It transmits radio signals that wireless devices can detect and connect to, allowing them to access the network.
    Data Routing: Once connected, the WAP routes data between the wireless device and the wired network, facilitating communication and internet access.

üè† Common Use Cases
    Home Networks: Providing Wi-Fi access to various devices within a household.
    Business Environments: Enabling employees and guests to connect wirelessly to the company's network.
    Public Spaces: Offering internet access in areas like cafes, libraries, and airports.

üîÑ WAP vs. Wireless Router
    While both devices provide wireless connectivity, they serve different purposes:
    Wireless Router: Combines the functions of a router and a WAP, providing both wired and wireless connectivity, along with routing capabilities.
    Wireless Access Point: Primarily focuses on providing wireless access to an existing wired network, without routing functions.
