What is IP?
IP (Internet Protocol) is the set of rules that devices use to communicate over the internet by assigning addresses to each device.

ðŸ”¹ IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)
      Address format: 32-bit numeric address, written as four decimal numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
      Number of addresses: About 4.3 billion unique addresses.
      Address types: Unicast, multicast, and broadcast.
      Header size: 20 bytes.
      Address configuration: Can be manual or automatic (DHCP).
      Security: Optional (IPSec is optional).
      Compatibility: Widely used and supported by almost all devices.
      Limitations: Running out of available addresses due to limited size.

ðŸ”¹ IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)
      Address format: 128-bit hexadecimal address, written as eight groups separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334).
      Number of addresses: About 3.4 x 10^38 addresses (virtually unlimited).
      Address types: Unicast, multicast, and anycast (no broadcast).
      Header size: 40 bytes (simplified header for efficiency).
      Address configuration: Supports auto-configuration (stateless address autoconfiguration).
      Security: IPSec support is mandatory.
      Compatibility: Not backward compatible with IPv4, requires transition mechanisms.
      Advantages: Solves IPv4 exhaustion, better routing, improved security, and simplified network configuration.
