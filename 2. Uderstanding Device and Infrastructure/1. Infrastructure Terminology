      Network	                          A group of connected devices that share data and resources.
      Server	                          A computer that provides services (like websites, files, or apps) to others.
      Data Center	                      A facility that houses servers, storage, and networking equipment.
      Firewall	                        A security device that filters incoming and outgoing network traffic.
      Router	                          A device that connects different networks and routes data between them.
      Switch	                          Connects devices within a network and directs data to the correct device.
      IP Address	                      A unique number assigned to each device on a network.
      DNS (Domain Name System)	        Translates domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses.
      Bandwidth	                        The amount of data that can be transferred over a network in a given time.
      Latency	                          The delay before data begins to transfer after a request.
      Cloud Infrastructure	            Servers and services provided over the internet (e.g., AWS, Azure).
      Virtualization	                  Running multiple systems (VMs) on a single physical machine.
      Load Balancer	                    Distributes network or application traffic across multiple servers.

üîê Security-Specific Infrastructure Terms:
      Term	                                        Definition
      
      DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)	                    A zone between internal and external networks to add extra security.

      VPN (Virtual Private Network)	                Encrypts internet traffic and hides online identity.
      Proxy Server	                                Intermediary server between users and the internet for filtering and privacy.
