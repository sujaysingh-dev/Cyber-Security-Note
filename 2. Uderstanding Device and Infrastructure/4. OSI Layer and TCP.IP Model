üî∑ OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)
    Developed by ISO (International Organization for Standardization)
    Conceptual model to standardize the functions of a communication system
    Has 7 layers
    Mostly used for learning and design, not direct implementation

üî∂ TCP/IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol Model)
    Developed by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)
    Based on real protocols used on the Internet
    Has 4 layers
    Widely used in real-world networking and communication

üìå Why Both Matter
    OSI Model: Helps students and professionals understand how networking works, step by step.
    TCP/IP Model: Reflects how the Internet and modern networks actually operate.
