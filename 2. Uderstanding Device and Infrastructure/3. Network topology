Network topology refers to the layout or structure of how computers, devices, and cables are connected in a network. It shows how data flows between devices.

ðŸ”‘ Types of Network Topologies:

      Topology	  Description	                                                            Pros	                                            Cons
      
      Bus	        All devices connected to a single central cable (the bus).	            Easy to set up, low cost.	                        Slow with many devices, hard to troubleshoot.
      Star	      All devices connect to a central device (like a switch or hub).	        Easy to manage, reliable.	                        If central device fails, network goes down.
      Ring	      Devices connected in a circle, data travels in one direction.	          Easy to install, good for small networks.	        One device failure can affect the whole network.
      Mesh	      Every device connects to every other device.	                          Very reliable, no single point of failure.	      Expensive and complex.
      Tree	      Combination of star and bus topology.	                                  Scalable and easy to manage.	                    If root node fails, parts of the network go down.
      Hybrid	    Mix of two or more topologies.	                                        Flexible and scalable.	                          Can be complex to design and manage.
